# Questions to Ask to every volunteer

**_Posted on 25 Apr, 2023_**

- What are some things that you don't like about the community?
- Do you have any ideas to fix them? How?
- When was the last time you found something useful on the community?
- What's your personal motivation to join and what do you get out of it?
