# What does a Community Lead (or Organiser) do?

**_Posted on 28 Mar, 2024_**

> I am not professionally involved with building & managing communtiies. Writing my thoughts based on trying to manage r/developersIndia.

1. Making sure all feedback is heard and documented in some form.
2. Answer any critical questions about the community.
3. Make sure the community is a safe space for everyone. This is very opinionated and can be a grey area.
4. Make sure that people who want to help as voluteers, get to do so.
5. If possible, regularly sync with other team members to make sure everyone is on the same page. This is necessary to build trust.
6. If possible, stengthen cross-community relationships. I am talking partnerships, collaborations, etc.
7. Obviously you are responsible for setting out any fires that might come up i.e, setting up disputes, etc.
