## Questions

> These questions are for everyone to answer. Feel free to start a conversation with your colleagues or friends.

1. Do you think that the lack of women in tech as leaders is due to the fact that there's a pay parity in comparison to men?
2. Assume, that the pay parity didn't exist and eveyrone was paid acording to skill and luck, do you think we could reach the balance of more women in tech?
3. Do you think diversity programs help as an entry gate to large organisations and there should be more of them?
4. Do you think there's a lack of mentorship for women in core tech domains?
5. Hyothetically, assume you are a leader in some programming domain (Very senior enginneer with decades of exp), do you have any inititatives in your mind that you would like to execute?
