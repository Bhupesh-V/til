# Functional Programming in Python üêç
<!--3 Jul 2019 -->
Features like `lambda`, `map`, `filter`, `reduce` are generally used to perform functional programming related tasks in Python.
Let's take a quick look on them.

### Lambdas
- Anonymous functions
- No function name, 
- They can be passed as function arguments/objects.
- No `return` statement, evaluated expression is returned automatically.
- Single line function.

Example : 

```python
double = lambda x: x*x
print(double(34))

elementList = [34, 56, 78, 90, 0, 12]
doubleList = lambda elementList: [e*e for e in elementList]
print(doubleList(elementList))
```

### Map
- applies a function to all the items in an input list.
- `map(function_to_apply, list_of_inputs)`.

Example :

```python
myList = ["bhupesh", "varshney", "is", "a", "developer"]

capitalize = list(map(lambda x: x.upper(), myList))
print(capitalize)
```

### Filter
- creates a list of elements for which a function returns `True`.

Example :

```python
mylist = [23, 45, 6, 8, 10, 16]
evenList = list(filter(lambda x: x%2 == 0, mylist))
print(evenList)
```

### Reduce
- accepts a function and a sequence(list/set *etc*) and returns a single value calculated.
- Initially, the function is called with the first two items from the sequence and the result is returned.
- The function is then called again with the result obtained in step 1 and the next value in the sequence. This process keeps repeating until there are items in the sequence.

Example :

```python
from functools import reduce

li = [5, 8, 10, 20, 50, 100]

sum = reduce((lambda x, y: x + y), li) 
print(sum)
```
