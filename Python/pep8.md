# PEP8 - the fashion ðŸ’ƒ police of Python
<!--22 Jun 2019 -->
Well basically PEP8 is a style guide which provides guidelines and best practices
for writing python code.

### How I learn?
Well bascially the official Python docs for [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) seems good but I use [pep8.org](https://pep8.org/).
It provides much more cleaner interface.

### Summary
Below is a summary which includes some go-to rules you can memorize.

1. Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
2. Spaces are preferred instead of tabs (Why ?? :disappointed_relieved:)
   Python disallows mixing of Tabs & Spaces (Syntax Errors).
   So be consistent with what you choose, I prefer tabs :wink:
3. Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters. Use \ to break/continue line.
4. Never use the characters â€˜lâ€™ (lowercase letter el), â€˜Oâ€™ (uppercase letter oh), or â€˜Iâ€™ (uppercase letter eye) as single character variable names. These are misunderstood with numerals one and zero in some font styles.
5. Function Names - lowercase words separated by _ .
6. Class Names - Start each word with a capital letter. Use CamelCase E.g StudentClass

### Tools 
If use Sublime Text, you can install [Python PEP8 Autoformat](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Python%20PEP8%20Autoformat) - it does the job for you.
