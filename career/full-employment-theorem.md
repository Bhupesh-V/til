# Full employment theorem
**_Posted on 10 March, 2024_** 

No matter how good someone is at their job, there will always be more work for them because there's no way to make everything perfect. So, people in fields where the **full-employment theorem can be proved** will always have something to do because there's always something that can be made better or improved upon.

This perfectly describes _compiler writers_ because there can not exist a perfectly optimizing compiler for a Turing-complete language, so there will always exist implementations of some programs for which a compiler does not find the corresponding optimal implementation. Hence, there will always be work for compiler writers.
