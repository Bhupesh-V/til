1. Basically stands for copying your production container (ðŸŸ¦) to a new one (ðŸŸ©)
2. Applying your changes to the new green container
3. Push this container to prod alongside the blue one
4. Perform any automated tests / QA
5. Gradually redirect your users to the new deployment (load balancing)
6. Once the transition completes, the blue container can become a backup in case you need to rollback or it can be dumped
