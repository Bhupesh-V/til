# Einstellung effect

**_Posted on 19 Apr, 2024_**

- The [Einstellung effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstellung_effect) occurs when a person uses a familiar solution to solve a problem, despite the availability of a more efficient alternative.
- This bias can prevent individuals from finding the best solution to a problem, trying out new things and experimenting.
- In my domain, this can be sometimes seen as "Resistance to Change". The Einstellung effect can lead to resistance towards adopting new methodologies or paradigms in software development. Engineers might be less open to exploring different approaches if they are overly attached to familiar ways of working.
