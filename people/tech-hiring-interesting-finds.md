# Interesting Views on Tech Hiring

A collection of views around the internet that I found interesting and useful for tech hiring.

## Personal Notes

- No one owes you a job. Our ecosystem in not regulated, meaning there will never be a sure short way to get a job.
- Interviewing is a trust exercise. Both the parties have to settle on a common ground so that they can work together. Unfortunately, the _trust_ has to be proved
  - In a very short time.
  - By solving meaningless puzzles.

  Both of which do not work in favor of the candidate, majority of the time.
