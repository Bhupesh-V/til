# Interesting Views on Tech Hiring

A collection of views around the internet that I found interesting and useful for tech hiring.

## Personal Notes

- No one owes you a job. Our ecosystem in not regulated, meaning there will never be a sure short way to get a job.
- Interviewing is a trust exercise. Both the parties have to settle on a common ground so that they can work together. Unfortunately, the _trust_ has to be proved
  - In a very short time.
  - By solving meaningless puzzles.

  Both of which do not work in favor of the candidate, majority of the time.
- Tech workers, don't know how to interview, its an acquired skill. And the only way to get better at it is to interview more which means that there's no guarantee that you are being "judged" fairly or by the right person.
- An engineering team member knows best on what kind of people their team needs, the team itself in that case can be a good gatekeeper in that regard.
