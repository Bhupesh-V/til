- What do you consider as your greatest achievement so far?
- What makes you who are you today?
- Tell us about a really difficult technical problem you solved. What was it and what did you build?
- What's the best thing you've made without anybody asking?
- What's the first thing you built? When and why did you build it?
- What's a popular opinion that you agree with?
- What great software is nobody building?
