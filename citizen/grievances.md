# Grievance Sites for Indian Citizens

How I deal with complaints in my nation ☹️

- [PGMS (Delhi)](#pgms-delhi)
- [LG (Delhi)](#lg-delhi)
- [CPGRAMS (Nation Wide)](#cpgrams-nation-wide)
- [Grieveance Formats](#grieveance-formats)
  - [DJB Mutation](#djb-mutation)


## PGMS (Delhi)

https://pgms.delhi.gov.in/

Thoughts:
- Works without OTP.
- Check the status of complaint every week, sometimes you won't get any intimation and the grievance will be closed (with a reply).

## LG (Delhi)

https://listeningpostdelhilg.in

Thoughts:
- Requires OTP.
- From my experience, complaint turnaround time could be anything from 15-30 days. You should get a call from some govt. employee in this time period.
- Check the status of complaint every week, sometimes you won't get any intimation and the grievance will be closed (with a reply).

## CPGRAMS (Nation Wide)

https://pgportal.gov.in/

Thoughts:
- Majorly useless, all grienavnces are forwarded and closed without any resolutions. I recommend not wasting time here, but try it if you don't have any other option.


## Grieveance Formats

### DJB Mutation

DJB is notorious on rejecting meter mutation applications (without any reason), following is a format adapted from [this source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5blUrgCa4hk), that can be used to file a grievance.

```
Dear Sir/Madam,


This is in reference to my Application Ref. No. XXX for Mutation on DJB website. My application for Mutation has been rejected without any reason. All required documents were uploaded during the application process.

I also visited the DJB office in ADD OFFICE LOCATION under the instruction received via a phone call from a DJB employee (refer their name here). I took both original and photocopy of required documents, including the self-declaration form and current meter reading.

I didn't receive any calls or intimations on why my mutation has been rejected.

Kindly reopen this mutation ARN and do the needful.

Thanks & Regards,

Name: Your Name
Mobile No: Your mobile
