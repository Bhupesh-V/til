# Checklist for documenting a medium to large scale system architecture



Some items that can help you document a undocumented legacy system.

- [ ] Identify common points of failure in the architecture.
- [ ] Identify uptime maintained in the last year (in 9s).
- [ ] Identify maintainer/dev team size.
- [ ] Identify specific version numbers of SDKs, APIs and packages used.
  - [ ] Identify if updating SDKs can break the system.
- [ ] Get entire server inventory list with os details.
- [ ] Create documentation for the deployment strategies.
- [ ] Create as many flowcharts/visual representations of the modules as possible. Way more than textual documents.
- [ ] Make notes. Make lots of notes. Don't discard/delete anything. When you are actually documenting things, make sure all the notes you have made are checked for inclusion.
