## Short Introduction

- ISRO came up with ISES 92 (ISRO Software Engineering Standards).
- ISRO Software Control Board (ISCB) came into existence which brought out “ISRO Software Process
Document” (ISPD) based on IEEE 12207:2015 framework for software life cycle activities.

## ISRO Software Process Document (ISPD)

### ISPD Issue 1

- ISPD Issue 1 was released to use the common standard in all centres for implementing IEEE 12207:1996.
- Followed to develop systems like onboard software, Checkout & Simulation software, Launch Operations Support & Test Facilities software, Image/data processing software.
- Main focus was on:
  - software requirements
  - design
  - implementation
  - software verification and validation, maintenance
  - configuration management

### ISPD Issue 2

- Included new category of sofware like
  - Spacecraft operations software,
  - FPGA design
  - system software
- ISPD Issue 2 addressed
  - Risk management
  - Knowledge management
  - System analysis
  - Decision management.
- ISCB has generated ISRO Software Safety Standard (ISSS) to be used by all software teams across all centres of ISRO to realise safety critical software and to achieve zero defect in space systems.


## Processes for Safety Critical Software

A. Agreement Processes
B. Organisational Project-Enabling Processes
C. Technical Management Processes
D. Technical processes

### A. Agreement Processes

- Specifies the requirements for the establishment of agreements between **suppliers** and **acquirers**.
- Processes are executed through the _purchase_ procedure between acquisition and supply processes for the establishment of expectations and responsibilities related software assurance.
- In the acquisition process project requirements are met and in supply process these requirements are serviced.

### B. Organisational Project-Enabling Processes

- Concerned with meeting the project requirements by providing the resources required.
- Includes sub-processes like
  - Life cycle management
  - Infrastructure management
  - Project portfolio management
  - Human resource management
  - Quality management
  - Knowledge management

### C. Technical Management Processes

- Establish and perform technical plans for the project.
- These include
  - Project planning
  - Project assessment and control
  - Decision management
  - Risk management
  - Configuration management
  - Information management
  - Measurement process
  - Quality assurance and certification
