Readers should nod their head yes to the headline, subheading, and first sentence.
If they've made it to the third sentence, they're ready for an interesting and compelling story.

- “Good writing is supposed to evoke sensation in the reader, not the fact that it’s raining, but the feeling of being rained upon.” - Sol Stein

- Great writers unlock the ELECTRICITY of sight. They give their readers a pair of Magic Binoculars.

- "Facts alone aren’t enough. They’re too black-and-white. Readers yearn for stories, images, and anecdotes that make the information POP."

## Verbose thinking is necessary

“It’s only by concentrating, sticking to the question, being patient, letting all the parts of my mind come into play, that I arrive at an original idea. By giving my brain a chance to make associations, draw connections, take me by surprise” — _William Deresiewicz_

I usually  think about the layout of the post while doing boring chores (making food). Schedule time to think and hone your understanding of the problem.

## Validating an Idea
Some of the points that help me land a decision:

- Are people not aware of this _idea_? Is it buried down in the messy internet?
- Is it hard to understand?
- What are the future implications after I write this post?
