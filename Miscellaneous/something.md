- ISRO came up with ISES 92 (ISRO Software Engineering Standards).
- ISRO Software Control Board (ISCB) came into existence which brought out ‚ÄúISRO Software Process
Document‚Äù (ISPD).
- Different classes of software used in different centres of ISRO.
  - ISPD Issue 1 was released to use the common standard in all centres for implementing IEEE
12207:1996.
  - Followed to develop software like onboard software, Checkout & Simulation software, Launch Operations Support & Test Facilities software, Image /data processing software.
  - ISPD Issue 2 addressed risk management, knowledge management, system analysis, decision management etc.

- ISRO Software Safety Standard (ISSS) will be used by all software teams across all centres of ISRO to realise safety critical software and to achieve zero defect in space systems.

- In supply process these requirements are serviced

### Organisational Project-Enabling Processes

- Concerned with meeting the project requirements by providing the resources required

### Technical Management Processes
