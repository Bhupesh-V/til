# Semantic Versioning
<!-- 24 Jul 2019 -->
- Describes how softwares are assigned version numbers.
- We generally see 3 parts in a version number, `x.y.z` (MAJOR, MINOR, PATCH)
	1. `x` represents MAJOR part - meant for describing any major backend code changes, support of APIs etc.
	2. `y` represents MINOR part - meant for describing very small changes.
	3. `z` represents PATCH part - meant for describing bug fixes.
