# Internet search tips & tricks for developers
<!-- 7 June 2020 -->
All of the below mentioned tips works in both DuckDuckGo & Google (i use both :wink:), it should work fine in other search engines too.

1. **`file:pdf golang`**

   > Use it to search for books, presentations or specific file types

2. **`inurl:docs.djangoproject.com templates`**

   > Use it to look for occurence of some phrases in the URL of the website mentioned.
   `inurl` [docs.djangoproject.com](docs.djangoproject.com) look for `templates` phrase.

3. **`site:github.com synatx error`**

   > Limit search results to a specific site, good for looking for bug fixes.

4. **`"how to add pagination in django"`**

   > Double quotes can be used for exact matches of the phrase (doesn't work sometimes).

5. **`related:http://freecodecamp.org`**

   > Related specifier, "related:<domain>" returns the root domain of similar websites

6. **`intitle:best vim plugins`** 

   > Intitle specifier returns results that contains your searched word in the title.
