# Internet search tips & tricks for developers

All of the below mentioned tips works in both DuckDuckGo & Google (i use both :wink:), it should work fine in other search engines too.

1. `filetype:pdf golang`
Use it to search for books or specific file types. Works in both Google & DuckDuckGo.

2. `inurl:docs.djangoproject.com templates`
Use it to look for occurence of some phrases in the URL of the website mentioned.
`inurl` [docs.djangoproject.com](docs.djangoproject.com) look for `templates` phrase.

3. `site:github.com synatx error`
Limit search results to a specific site, good for looking for bug fixes.

4. `"how to add pagination in django"`
Double quotes can be used for exact matches of the phrase (doesn't work sometimes).
