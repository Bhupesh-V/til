# Writing Functions
<!-- 24 Jun 2019 -->
Got to learn some new points regarding functions() in CleanCode.

1. Functions should be small.
2. They should do one thing only.
   > FUNCTIONS SHOULD DO ONE THING. THEY SHOULD DO IT WELL.
     THEY SHOULD DO IT ONLY.
3. To know if a function is doing more than "one thing" see if you can extract another
   funtion from it with a name that is not merely a restatement of its implementation.
4. Function arguments should *NEVER* be greater than 3.
5. We should never ignore any part of code.The parts we ignore are where the bugs will hide.

_PS : I have been reading [CleanCode](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/clean-code/9780136083238/) for a while & logging what I learn here._
