# Naming Variables & Functions
<!--24 Jun 2019 -->
1. The name of a variable, function, or class should answer all the big questions.
   It should tell you why it exists, what it does, and how it is used.
2. Classes & Objects should have *noun* or noun phrase names like *Student*,*Account* etc.
   A class name should not be a *verb*.
3. Methods should have verb or verb phrase names like *getCategories()*, *saveTutorial()*.
