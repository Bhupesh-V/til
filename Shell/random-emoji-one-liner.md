# Random emoji ğŸ˜² in one line
<!-- 30 July 2020 -->
```bash
rand_int=$(shuf -i600-700 -n1); printf "%b\n" "\U1F$rand_int"
```

> PS: I am still working on a better way, this will only generate emojis in UNICODE range `1F601` to `1F700` while ignoring codepoints like `1F60A` ğŸ˜Š. Let me know if you have a beter way (create an issue)
