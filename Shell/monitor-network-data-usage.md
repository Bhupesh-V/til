# Monitor network (data) usage

The amount of data sent(uploaded) & received (downloaded) can be found out
using the following bash script.

- Only works per session, i.e stats are gathered once you power up your PC (or login).
- Good to have if you have limited data avaiability & want to montior your data usage.

```bash

netu() {
    # [net]work [u]sage: check network usage stats

    net_device=$(route | awk '/default/ {print $8}')
    TRANSMITTED=$(ifconfig "$net_device" | awk '/TX packets/ {print $6$7}')
    RECEIVED=$(ifconfig "$net_device" | awk '/RX packets/ {print $6$7}')

    pc_uptime=$(uptime -p | awk '{for (i=2; i<NF; i++) printf $i " "; if (NF >= 1) print $NF; }')
    printf "%s\n\n" "Network Usage since $pc_uptime"
    printf "%s\n" "$(tput bold)ðŸ”¼ TRANSMITTED $(tput sgr0): $TRANSMITTED"
    printf "%s\n" "$(tput bold)ðŸ”½ RECEIVED    $(tput sgr0): $RECEIVED"
}

```
