# How I think about Green Software

I look at it from 3 perspectives:

## POV 1: As a Software Design & Implementation Problem

Includes basic things from reducing memory allocations while write code to using public cloud services to reduce energy consumption.

## POV 2: From a Organizational Lens

Includes things like how to build a culture of energy efficiency, how to measure and track energy consumption within a team or organization. Do your team members give a fuck about climate change? If yes, with what intensity?

## POV 3: As a vigilant consumer of electronic devices

- This usually involves looking at harware efficiency of electronics that I may buy or sell (Embodied carbon).
- Eco modes in devices.
