# Net Promoter Score (NPS)



https://www.netpromotersystem.com/

- Metric used to measure customer loyalty.
- Calculated by asking customers how likely they are to recommend a product or service to a friend or colleague on a scale of 0 to 10.

## Calculation

- Promoters (score 9-10): Loyal customers who are likely to recommend the product or service.
- Passives (score 7-8): Satisfied customers who are unlikely to actively promote the product or service.
- Detractors (score 0-6): Unhappy customers who are likely to discourage others from using the product or service.

The Net Promoter Score is calculated by subtracting the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters. The score can range from -100 to 100, with a higher score indicating higher customer loyalty.
