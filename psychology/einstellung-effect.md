# Einstellung effect



- The [Einstellung effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstellung_effect) occurs when a person uses a familiar solution to solve a problem, despite the availability of a more efficient alternative.
- This bias can prevent individuals from finding the best solution to a problem, trying out new things and experimenting.
- In my domain, this can be sometimes seen as "Resistance to Change". This effect can lead to resistance towards adopting new methodologies or paradigms in software development.
