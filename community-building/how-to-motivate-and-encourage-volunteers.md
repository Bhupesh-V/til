> Jotting down tips on "how to help volunteers, so that they help the community".

1. Give full ownership on what volunteers pick up to do.
2. Remind them why they volunteer.
3. Have regular 1-1s if possible.
4. Don't let them take too much work that may lead to burnout.
5. Insist them to talk about their contribtions publicly, add it in their resume.
6. Figure out what motivates them & help them drive that motivation for them.
7. Figure out how you (as a lead/manager) can make the experience better.
