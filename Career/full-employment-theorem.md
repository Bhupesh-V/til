# Full employment theorem
**_Posted on 10 March, 2024_** 

No matter how good someone is at their job, there will always be more work for them because there's no way to make everything perfect. So, people in these fields will always have something to do because there's always something that can be made better or improved upon.

This perfectly describes compiler writers because there can not exist a perfectly optimizing compiler for a Turing-complete language, so there will always exist implementations of some programs for which a compiler does not find the corresponding optimal implementation. Hence, there will always be work for compiler writers.

In times of AI, this theorem is still valid because AI can't solve every problem. It can solve a lot of problems, but it can't solve every problem. There will always be problems that are too hard for AI to solve, and there will always be work for people to do.
