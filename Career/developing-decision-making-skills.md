# Invest in decision making skills early in career
**_Posted on 02 Jan, 2022_**

**Current Situation**:
Engineers are solution oriented and often think in terms of how, rather than what & why?. This leads to
- Stalled career growth as the work gets unpleasant.
- In cases it can lead to debate, followed by judging each other's characted and skils.
- Affects company's growth, since if engineers focus on how then there a chance people move in different directions

**Solution**:
Develop decision making skills by watershedding method

Now, wtf is water shedding?
> It is used to collect rain, watershedds is a large area of land (in slope) to collect the rain water.

1. *Upper Section* responsible for storing the bulk of water to prevent flooding.
2. *Middle Section* for slowing down the flow of water & removing pollutants to ensure the water downstream is safe.
3. *Lower Section* for utilising the water.

> Key Learning: Everything that happens downstream is connected to what happens upstream.

We can use the same pattern to make decisions,
1. **Roots**, *(upper section)*
   - Define the goal and problem
   - Establish shared priorties
   - Define decision criteria
2. **Tributaries** *(middle section)*
   - Generate Solutions
   - Evaluate solutins using the defined criteria
   - Identify solution trade-off to minimize risk
3. **Lakes** *(lower section)*
   - Documenting the decision
   - Communicating to stakeholders

## How to watershed

1. Know your location in the watershed
2. Articulate and build alignment around your criteria
3. Diverge before you converge (sufficient time to think broadly, do brainstorming)
4. Communicate, communicate, communicate
5. Diagnose when things are off-track & adjust (mitigate risk)
