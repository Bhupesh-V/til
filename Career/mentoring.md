# Mentoring

**_Posted on 31 Mar, 2024_**

Collected in-progress thoughts on mentoring (both sides).

## 2-way street

- Push people out-of-their-comfort-zone, make them a little bit uncomfortable.
- Showing vulnerability as a mentor. None of us have all the answers.
- "I have feedback for you" as a phrase can be intimidating. Couple of pointers while giving feedback:
  - Ask permission
  - Genuinely care.
  - +ve intent
  - Give feedback early and often (do not delay)
  - Be to the point

## Questions to ask the mentee

- What do you want to achieve, get out of mentorship?
- No firm goals & expectations can lead to disappointment & guilt later on where both mentor & mentee feel like they were not able to get the most out of the relationship.
