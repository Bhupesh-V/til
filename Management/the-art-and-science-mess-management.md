# The art and science of mess management
**_07 Jan, 2025_**

> The following piece of knowledge is (humanly) summarised & gathered from the paper ["The Art and Science of Mess Management"](https://www.systemswisdom.com/sites/default/files/Ackoff-1981-Mess-Management_0.pdf) by Russell L. Ackoff.

There are 3 kinds of things that can be done with a problem:

## 1. Resolving (aka Clinical Approach)

- A course of action whose outcome is good enough.
- Based on judgement, experience, and intuition.
- Based on qualitative analysis.

> Most managers are problem resolvers.

## 2. Solving (aka Research Approach)

- A course of action whose outcome is optimal.
- Based on scientific method, techniques, and tools.

> Most engineers (and folks in adjacent fields) are problem solvers.

## 3. Dissolving (aka Design Approach)

- To disolve a problem is to make it disappear.
- The system or environment is changed so that the problem no longer exists.
- Not all problems require a additive solution, sometime subtracting something from the system can solve the problem.
